This program uses the `soft_pwm` kernel module I found and updated here: https://github.com/danielscottjames/soft_pwm Hopefully using that is as easy as `make` and `sudo insmod soft_pwn.ko`. This module uses a high resolution timer in the kernel to produce the smoothest pulses, and thus prevents servo jitter which you'd see from a userspace solution. There are other options for controlling the GPIO pins on a pi, but I like this module because it's portable. Actually I think the kernel now supports a similar pwm interface natively and I would like to figure out how that works one day.
